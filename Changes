        - bugfix for option key.  using > 2 alternate option names in v0.03
          incorrectly used the shortest long option name.  The first long
          option name in the list should be used.  (now documented in POD)
        - default to ($main::VERSION || '1.0') as the version number
        - tried to make POD explain things better

        - added support for --man option (displays POD)
        - now supports an arbitrary number of option name alternatives
          (previously each option required two option names, one short and
          one long).
        - added unit tests
