Getopt::Compact.pm version 0.03
===============================

This is yet another Getopt related module.  Getopt::Compact is geared
towards compactly and yet quite powerfully describing an option
syntax.  Options can be parsed, returned as a hashref of values,
and/or displayed as a usage string.  Options can be retrieved in a
single statement by instantiating a Getopt::Compact object and calling
the opts() method (see SYNOPSIS).

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
